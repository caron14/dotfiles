We use Black for Python code formatter, so when talking about Python codes, always give me code samples that follows the code guideline based on Black. 
Regarding docstring, please follow the Google style. The example is below.

def sample_function(param1, param2):
    """
    This is the sample function for explanaton.

    Args:
        param1 (int): The first parameter.
        param2 (str): The second parameter.

    Returns:
        bool: The return value. True for success, False otherwise.

    Note:
        - The specific note about this function.
    """


For SQL script, we always use BigQuery, so when talikng about SQL code, always give me query samples for BigQuery.
